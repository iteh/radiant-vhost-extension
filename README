Host multiple separate websites on the same Radiant installation each with their 
own users, pages, snippets and layouts (soon to be supporting other extensions).  
Administer users and sites from any domain using your administrative accounts 
and manage website content by logging into each domain.

IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT VHOST
- Not compatible with the multi_site extension
- Uses the scoped_access plugin, make sure none of your extensions have a 
  conflicting version of the plugin.
- Hooks into the Radiant 'bootstrap' functionality and currently overwrites the
  standard templates with a modified version of the Simple Blog (i.e. no Styled
  Blog or Coffee template)

INSTRUCTIONS
Currently (April 26th, 2009) you need the freshest version of Radiant (0.7.1) 
which includes Rails 2.2.2 to run vhost. The following instructions use git
to directly check out the latest version of Radiant so you may need to adjust
them slightly. Once the Radiant gem supports Rails 2.2.2 these instructions
will reflect the proper way to run and install vhost.

* Run 'git clone git://github.com/radiant/radiant.git yoursite'
* In /yoursite run:
  * git submodule init
  * git submodule update
* Create production, development and test database schemas
* Update /yoursite/config/database.yml to point to the schemas
* In /yoursite/vendor/extensions run:
  * git clone git://github.com/kalebwalton/radiant-vhost-extension.git vhost
* In /yoursite/vendor/extensions/vhost run:
  * git submodule init
  * git submodule update
* In /yoursite run:
  * rake development db:bootstrap
  * rake db:test:clone_structure (this one may be unnecessary)
  * rake db:test:clone
* Finally, in /yoursite run:
  * rake spec:extensions EXT=vhost

You should see a number of spec examples running and passing. If you don't, 
or they're failing, something has gone wrong!
